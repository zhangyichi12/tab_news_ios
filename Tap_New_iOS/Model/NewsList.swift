That result probably added to a bubbling level of vitriol from the portion of the fan base that's growing sick and tired of being sick and tired, but it didn't really change anything. Michigan had major problems in 2017 and the result of the Outback Bowl was never going to change that. \n Jim Harbaugh's coaching staff already has been tweaked. More change is on the way.
